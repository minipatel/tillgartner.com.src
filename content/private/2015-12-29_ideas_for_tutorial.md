I thought of making a tutorial about how to set up a website / blog on github; just as I have done it recently. This could be helpful for other people, and I personally know at least 5 people that would be interested. Furthermore this way I would have a documentation of what I have done to setup my website.

I would want the tutorial to be really detailed, i.e. all the steps should be documented and filmed.

#Structure

##Part 1

Goal: Have a index.html page out there accessible by everyone

The script would be roughly as follows:

- For whom is this kind of hosting appropriate
- What is github, how is it used normally. Explain by browsing thru it.
- Show some web sites that are hosted at github
- Create an account at github, user till.tutorial@gmail.com
- Make a project called myWebsite
- Fill the readme thru the web UI
- Explain roughly how Git works, reference to the Atlassian tutorial
- Explain that you can use it via command line or via github software - we will start with the github program
- Download it & start it
- Create the naked index.html page
- Create the branch gh-pages and upload index.html into that
- Show that you can call your page on the web

##Part 2
Goal: Have a first little website out there

##Part 3
Goal: Have it accessed by a real URL

##Part4
Goal: Have our first blog entry and setup workflow and tools

##Part5
Goal: Adapt design


#Other thoughts

- The turial could be hosted on a special site at http://tutorial.tillgartner.com
- I would have an extra email address for questions and the sort and used within the demo: till.tutorial@gmail.com
- The movies would be hosted on a Youtube channel owned by till.tutorial@gmail.com
- I would use the original mac terminal, not iTerm

##Questions
- How do I record what I do on the screen?
